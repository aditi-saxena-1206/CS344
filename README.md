# CS344
A repository of all the codes I create as part of my Artificial Intelligence course.

# 1. graph-search  
An implementation of the Uniform Cost Search and the A* search algorithms on a map of Goa. The graph is implemented using the NetworkX module.

# 2. tic-tac-toe  
A tic-tac-toe game which can be played against an AI agent. This has been implemented using the Minimax algorithm.

# 3. Gaussian Naive Bayes  
An implementation of a classification model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch. Dataset used is 'iris' in the scikit-learn library.

# 4. Gaussian Naive Bayes using Scikit-Learn package  
An implementation of a classification model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm from the Scikit-Learn package. Dataset used is 'iris' in the scikit-learn library.

# 5. Gaussian Naive Bayes on Zoo Dataset
