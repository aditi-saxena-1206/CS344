# CS344
A repository of all the codes I create as part of my Artificial Intelligence course.

### 1. graph-search  
An implementation of the Uniform Cost Search and the A* search algorithms on a map of Goa. The graph is implemented using the NetworkX module.

### 2. tic-tac-toe  
A tic-tac-toe game which can be played against an AI agent. This has been implemented using the Minimax algorithm.

### 3. Gaussian Naive Bayes  
An implementation of a classification model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch. Dataset used is 'iris' in the scikit-learn library.

### 4. Gaussian Naive Bayes using Scikit-Learn package  
An implementation of a classification model using the Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm from the Scikit-Learn package. Dataset used is 'iris' in the scikit-learn library.

### 5. Gaussian Naive Bayes on Zoo Dataset  
Naive Bayes Classification on UCI Zoo Dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo)

### 6. Markov Chain to simulate website visits  
Markov chain implementation analyse and simulate yearly user visits on a website and reach a stationary distribution.
